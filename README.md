# Group Tracker


Group Tracker is an Android application that makes it easier to plan trips with friends. Users can join or create events, communicate in a group chat and share their location with each other. The map displays live locations of all members in the group to make it easier to meet up and plan their commute. If a user is lost, they can send out a notification to all group members which contains their location, battery percentage and other useful information.

## Notes
- Firebase - Does not support arrays directly since array index is always changing and firebase is a real time db.  Creates problems when multiple users doing operations, array index shifts. Instead, it creates list of objects
- Always remember to detach listeners when needed
- Bugs/Challenges moved to commit log for commit on 6/6/20
